<h2> About me </h2>

I am a trained Economist with a strong background in <b>statistics</b>, and a passion for uncovering insights from data. My previous professional experience includes extensive consulting work on energy related policies. 

During the last few years I have pivoted into <b>data analytics</b>, with special interest in <b>public policy</b>, <b>consumer behavior</b>, <b>health policy</b>,  <b>natural language processing and social media analysis</b>, <b>machine learning for problem solving</b>, and <b>geospatial analysis</b>. 

I am currently a Master's student at Carnegie Mellon University, where I have refined and expanded my programming and analytical skill set. 

At Carnegie Mellon, I have collaborated as a Teaching Assistant for <b>Intermediate Python</b>, <b>Geographic Inforamtion Systems (GIS)</b>, and tutored for <b>Introduction to Programming with Python</b>
<br>

<!-- My main interests are:
Machine learning ..

To solve complex problems.
To get insights that would go unnoticed  

The use of data to better understand consumer behavior  

Social listening to enhance consumer experience

<h2> GIS  </h2>  
<b>Access to health services in Mexico City. The role of Medical Offices in Pharmacies (MOPs) --><a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/8381685eb7764b63b4a5b98e356b405a"> Story map</a></b><br>  
January, 2022 - May, 2022<br>
This geo spatial analysis shows that the main logic behind the expansion of MOPs in Mexico City has not been -as often publicized- trying to reach unserved population, but rather capturing a market previously served by other options of healthcare, rather than expanding towards underserved areas.
Additionally, state level data provides little evidence about the behavior of MOP doctors towards prescription drugs. But it provides somewhat stronger evidence about some of the factors that drive peoples decision to use their services (lower waiting time, and lower travel times)<br>

<b> Map tornadoes... in the U.S. with clustering analysis --> <a href="https://github.com/ribarragi/past_projects/blob/c0d279834473e786864dfe8da9f4c29dca2363de/GIS_tornadoes.pdf">Map</a></b><br>
March, 2022 <br>
Analyze historical data of tornadoes in the U.S. from 2000 throu 2008: perform k-means clustering on several measures of impact to identify areas with the most fatalities, injuries, and damages, and determine whether they fall inside or outside of "Tornado Alley", a location of central U.S. where tornadoes are most frequent. <br>
